Based off what I read on a paper dealing with CNN's and DogvsCat classifier. 

I added which was not on the paper a way to process frame by frame and make predictions based on the frame. 

So I am able to use my own camera to make the model make constant predictions on the frame it's capturing. 

It is messy and just wanted to keep this here to document it.
